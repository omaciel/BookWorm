# BookWork: Track and manage books you want to read.

I have been keeping track of all the books I read using a WordPress plugin called [*Now Reading Reloaded*](http://heliologue.com/projects/now-reading-reloaded/) but last time I checked, it is no longer being maintained. I could have looked around for alternatives, but decided instead to "roll my own" with a couple of objectives:

* Learn more Ruby on Rails by working on something I will actually use;
* Learn more about Test Driven Development using RSpec;
* Run as a standalone application and move away from "requiring" a WordPress instance;
* Add reporting features so I can track how many books, pages, authors I have read monthly, annually, all time;

Though I will probably make this generic enough so that anyone can use it, the main focus will be to accomplish the objectives mentioned above. If you want to help out, patches, encouragement and/or positive feedback will always be gladly received.

Soon I'll add a link here to a live instance...
